    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large chicken breasts, halved horizontally to make 4 cutlets</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian-style breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil, for frying</li>
        <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the chicken cutlets. Place them between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound to an even 1/4-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes. In the first, place the flour. In the second, the beaten eggs. In the third, mix the breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Dredge each chicken cutlet first in the flour, then dip in the egg, and finally press firmly into the breadcrumb mixture to coat completely.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the chicken cutlets for about 3-4 minutes per side, until golden brown and cooked through. Remove and place on a wire rack to drain.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Spoon a thin layer of marinara sauce in the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange the fried chicken on top.</li>
        <li>Spoon the remaining marinara sauce over the chicken, then sprinkle generously with the shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and slightly browned. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
