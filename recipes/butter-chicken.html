        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Gravy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato puree</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon crushed dried fenugreek leaves (Kasoori Methi)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine all ingredients for the chicken marinade. Add the chicken pieces, mix well, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 8 hours).</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat with a little oil or ghee. Cook the marinated chicken in batches until golden brown and cooked through. Set aside.</li>
        <li>To make the gravy, melt butter in the same pan. Add the chopped onion and saut√© until golden. Add the ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato puree, garam masala, red chili powder, and sugar. Cook for 10-12 minutes, until the sauce thickens and darkens.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked cashews and blend them with a little water to make a smooth paste. Add this cashew paste to the gravy and cook for 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Let the gravy cool slightly, then transfer it to a blender and blend until completely smooth.</li>
        <li>Return the smooth gravy to the pan. Add the cooked chicken and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Stir in the heavy cream and the crushed fenugreek leaves (Kasoori Methi). Simmer for 2 more minutes, but do not boil.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with your choice of rice or naan bread.</li>
