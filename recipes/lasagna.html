    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is a family favorite that comes straight from my grandmother's kitchen. It's the perfect dish for a cozy Sunday dinner or for feeding a hungry crowd. The rich meat sauce, creamy cheese filling, and tender pasta layers combine to create a truly comforting and delicious meal.</p>
    <p>While it takes a bit of time to assemble, every step is simple, and the results are absolutely worth it. Don't be afraid to make it your own by adding different cheeses or a pinch of red pepper flakes for some heat!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1 large white onion, minced</li>
    <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1 pound sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large skillet, cook the sausage and ground beef over medium heat until well browned. Stir in the onion and garlic and cook until translucent. Drain off any excess grease.</li>
    <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, and sugar. Season with basil and salt. Simmer, covered, for at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with the egg and half of the Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange noodles lengthwise over the sauce. Spread with one-half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of the mozzarella slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Repeat the layers, and top with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes until the top is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
    <li>Let the lasagna cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. This will help it set and make for cleaner slices.</li>
